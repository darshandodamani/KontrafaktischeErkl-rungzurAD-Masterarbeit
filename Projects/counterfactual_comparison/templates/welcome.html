            <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                A counterfactual explanation answers the question: 
                <em class="text-blue-500">"What needs to change in an input to get a different AI prediction?"</em>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mt-3">
                <strong>Example:</strong> If an AI system classifies a traffic image as 
                <span class="bg-red-500 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded-md">STOP</span>, 
                a counterfactual explanation shows how the image needs to change to be classified as 
                <span class="bg-green-500 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded-md">GO</span>.

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">📷 You will be shown:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 text-md">
                <li>An <strong>original image</strong> from an AI-driven vehicle.</li>
                <li>Three different <strong>counterfactual images</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">Compare the original and counterfactual images and rate them based on these factors:</p>

        <div class="mt-4 text-left bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="text-blue-600">Interpretability:</strong> Is the change understandable? Interpretability is about clarity—making sure the explanation is so simple that anyone can see exactly what change would alter the car’s decision.</li>
                <li>Imagine an autonomous vehicle slows down because it detects a pedestrian on the sidewalk. A counterfactual explanation might show the same scene with the pedestrian removed. If you can clearly see that the car would have maintained its speed if the pedestrian weren’t there, the explanation is interpretable. In simple terms, the viewer easily understands that the presence of the pedestrian was the key reason for slowing down.</li>
                <li><strong class="text-blue-600">Plausibility:</strong> Does the counterfactual look realistic? Plausibility checks whether the modified (counterfactual) image still looks like a realistic driving scene. The explanation must seem like something that could naturally occur on the road.</li>
                <li>Suppose the car decides to change lanes because it detected an obstacle on its current path. A plausible counterfactual explanation might show that if the obstacle were not present, the car would stay in its lane. However, if the modified image looks bizarre—say, the road suddenly appears warped or other vehicles vanish in an unrealistic manner—the explanation isn’t plausible. It should look like a scene that could actually happen on the road.
                </li>
                <li><strong class="text-blue-600">Visual Coherence:</strong> Are only relevant parts changed? Visual coherence means that only the parts of the image that need to change are altered, while everything else remains the same. This helps you focus on the exact element that influenced the decision.</li>
                <li>Imagine the vehicle stops because it detected a stray object (like a fallen branch) in its path. A visually coherent counterfactual explanation would only remove or change that object, leaving the rest of the scene—such as lane markings, buildings, and other vehicles—untouched. If the explanation instead shows an entirely different road or background, it loses coherence because it doesn’t clearly isolate the effect of the stray object on the decision.</li>
