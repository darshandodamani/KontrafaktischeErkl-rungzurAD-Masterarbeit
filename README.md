# A Counterfactual Explanation Approach Using Deep Generative Models

This repository contains the implementation of the research presented in my thesis, which focuses on improving the **explainability** of autonomous driving decisions through **counterfactual explanations**. By leveraging **Deep Generative Models**, this work aims to provide clear insights into the decision-making processes of autonomous vehicles, especially in critical driving scenarios.

# Overview
Autonomous driving systems make complex decisions based on various inputs from their environment. While these decisions are often accurate, there is a growing need to **understand why** a particular action was taken or why an alternative action wasn't chosen. To address this, we use **counterfactual explanations**, which help in determining what minimal changes in the input would alter the model's decision.
